  Make phantom nodes classes & running nodes instances
    Identify all the core APIs that work on nodes
      
    Split into versions for running and non-running nodes, with assertions
    Encapsulate the transition points in functions
    Fix call sites
    Make it all run + commit

    Replace ASSERT with %ASSERT as needed
    Deal with node init protocol
    Add a second system for looking up nodes
    Create nodes when they're run, destroy when they're done

  Port PROP code to run on top of ATTR
/   Further definer macro cleanup
    Rip our <node-prop-decl> and replace with attr/attr-default calls
  Port event APIs to new object system
  Move ruby-object tests from experiments.ss to somewhere more useful
  Refactor as much as possible in nodes.ss to be simpler
  Take care of TODO items

  Performance
    Major performance regression on features/mask/light in tamale_test
    Moderate performance regression on features/animation

  Better version of .SEND/APPLY for object methods?

  Get test cases for SET! SLOT from ruby-nodes.ss
X Figure out why KEYWORD? doesn't work in nodes.ss macro expansion - it's fine
  Why did we go into an infinite loop when accessing .RUNNING before it was
    initialized?
  Browser demo card dies on URLs or page titles containing unquoted & or <
  Why START, and not just INDEX?
