  Make phantom nodes classes & running nodes instances
/   Rename MAYBE-ENABLE-EXPENSIVE-EVENTS-FOR-CARD
/   Split hash table used by FIND-NODE into running/non-running versions
    Create nodes when they're run, destroy when they're done
/     ATTR on metaclasses won't default correctly
      Fix root node & callers
        NODE-FULL-NAME FIND-NODE-RELATIVE ANALYZE-NODE-NAME
        ENTER-NODE-RECURSIVELY EXIT-NODE-RECURSIVELY
      Fix DEFINE-NODE
        Becomes much like DEFINE-TEMPLATE
        INIT-FN can be removed from class and left only in metaclass
      Update CREATE as needed
        Need to deal with BINDINGS-EVAL-FN
      Update ENTER-NODE and EXIT-NODE
        Call sites allocate and deallocate instances
      Nuke STATE junk as much as we can
        Nuke everything related to ACTIVE?
        The running assertions can all come out

    STATIC-NODE or NODE-CLASS?

    Replace ASSERT with %ASSERT as needed 

  Port PROP code to run on top of ATTR
    Rip our <node-prop-decl> and replace with attr/attr-default calls
  Port event APIs to new object system
  Move ruby-object tests from experiments.ss to somewhere more useful
  Refactor as much as possible in nodes.ss to be simpler
  Take care of TODO items

  Performance
    Major performance regression on features/mask/light in tamale_test
    Moderate performance regression on features/animation

  Better version of .SEND/APPLY for object methods?

  Get test cases for SET! SLOT from ruby-nodes.ss
  Why did we go into an infinite loop when accessing .RUNNING before it was
    initialized?
  Browser demo card dies on URLs or page titles containing unquoted & or <
  Why START, and not just INDEX?
