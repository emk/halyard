 Revision 1.4  2002/05/15 11:05:17  emk
 3.3.3 - Merged in changes from FiveL_3_3_2_emk_typography_merge branch.
 Synopsis: The Common code is now up to 20Kloc, anti-aliased typography
 is available, and several subsystems have been refactored.  For more
 detailed descriptions, see the CVS branch.

 The merged Mac code hasn't been built yet; I'll take care of that next.

 Revision 1.3.4.1  2002/04/22 05:22:33  emk
 A weekend's worth of merging, in preparation for the Typography switchover.

 MOVED
 -----

 * Win32/Crypt/md5.c -> Common/libs/crypto/md5.c
 * Win32/Crypt/md5.h -> Common/libs/crypto/md5.h
 * Win32/Crypt/md5main.c -> Common/libs/crypto/md5main.c
 * Win32/Crypt/_blowfish.c -> Common/libs/crypto/blowfish.c
 * Win32/Crypt/blowfish.h -> Common/libs/crypto/blowfish.h

 Third-party cryptography files moved to the new Common/libs/crypto
 directory.  In general, third-party code should go under Common/libs, so we
 can find it all in one place for updates and license checks.
 Common/freetype2 will probably move there soon for the sake of consistency.

 MERGED
 ------

 * Win32/Crypt/CryptStream.cpp -> Common/CryptStream.cpp
 * Win32/Crypt/CryptStream.h -> Common/CryptStream.h
 * Win32/TestSuite/TestCryptStream.cpp -> Common/CryptStreamTests.cpp

 Modified to use the portable Path abstraction.  Included our standard key
 once in this file, instead of having it in many different headers
 throughout the program. Coerced uchar* to char* in several places required
 by the fstream API (and some other coercions).

 * Win32/FiveL/Parser.cpp -> Common/TParser.cpp
 * Win32/FiveL/Parser.h -> Common/TParser.h

 Merged in Elizabeth's improved escape-handling code.  Factored out all code
 which specifically referred to "card", "header" or "macrodef" forms, and
 added a generic API for registering abitrary top-level forms.

 * Win32/FiveL/Index.cpp -> Common/TIndex.cpp
 * Win32/FiveL/Index.h -> Common/TIndex.h
 * NEW: Common/TIndexTests.cpp
 * NEW: Common/Scripts/test.scr

 Merged TIndex::GetScript from the Macintosh.  Temporarily stopped closing
 the TIndexFile in the presence of REDOSCRIPT.  Merged some Macintosh code
 for building indices from FSSpecs; this probably doesn't work.  Changed the
 Open and Init methods to use the portable Path library (the APIs might be
 slightly suboptimal).

 * Win32/FiveL/LUtil.cpp -> Common/TDateUtil.cpp
 * Win32/FiveL/LUtil.h -> Common/TDateUtil.h

 Extracted date-related code from LUtil.*.  Changed wsprintf calls to
 sprintf.

 * Win32/FiveL/Variable.cpp -> Common/TVariable.cpp
 * Win32/FiveL/Variable.h -> Common/TVariable.h

 Disabled certain special variables that caused awkward dependencies, and
 replaced them with an interface for registering arbitrary special
 variables.

 MODIFIED
 --------

 * Common/FileSystem.cpp
 * Common/FileSystem.h

 Added a RenameFile function, and a GetScriptsDirectory function.  Also
 added a ReplaceWithTemporaryFile function, which overwrites an existing
 file with a temporary file (someday, we can implement this as an atomic
 operation on most operating systems).

 * Common/GraphicsTools.h

 Added a no-arguments constuctor for Point.

 * Common/TString.cpp
 * Common/TString.h

 Lots of "signed/unsigned comparison" and other warning fixes.

 * Common/TStyleSheet.cpp
 * Common/TStyleSheet.h

 Added full-fledged INCR_X, INCR_Y support!

 * Common/Typography.cpp
 * Common/Typography.h

 Made sure that kerning+advance can never move the drawing cursor backwards.
 Fixed warnings.

 * Common/fonttools/pngtest.cpp

 Added a test of transparent text (just for fun).

 KNOWN ISSUES
 ------------

 * Logging code needs to have Mac-specific features merged back in.

 * TIndexFile doesn't close the underlying file properly in the presence of
 REDOSCRIPT.  What's going on here?

 * TParser--and maybe TStream--need to have cross-platform end-of-line
 handling.

 Revision 1.3  2002/01/24 19:22:41  tvw
 Fixed bug (#531) in -D command-line option causing
 system registry read error.

 Revision 1.2  2002/01/23 20:39:20  tvw
 A group of changes to support a new stable build.

 (1) Only a single instance of the FiveL executable may run.

 (2) New command-line option "-D" used to lookup the installation directory in the system registry.
     Note: Underscores will be parsed as spaces(" ").
     Ex: FiveL -D HIV_Prevention_Counseling

 (3) Slow down the flash on buttpcx so it can be seen on
     fast machines.  A 200 mS pause was added.

 (4) Several bugfixes to prevent possible crashes when error
     conditions occur.

 Revision 1.1  2001/09/24 15:11:01  tvw
