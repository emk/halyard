    Bugs
      Fix stutter when switching from sine to vorbis clip (portaudio bug?)

    Useful features
      Geiger counters
        Mix pre-recorded loops with random synth
        Hook into Tamale for Geigers
        Hook into Quake for Geigers
      Hook into Quake for ambients
      Stereo panning
      Kill off Quake sound effects when leaving sim card group

    Less Important (Or Even Dubious)
      We're clipping the last 0.1 seconds or so (actually, I think
        portaudio is), and we should fix this
,     Try to get complete code coverage testing Vorbis playback path

  Make TException stop reporting line numbers
  Add EVENT-KEYS method to wrap EVENT-CHARACTER and EVENT-MODIFIERS

  Event Handling
    Nice features
      Send idle events to everything
      Returning values from event handlers?

    Areas in need of major refactoring
      Deletion of elements is a mess.  Fix.
      NODE-HAS-EXPENSIVE-HANDLERS? is currently a bit tricky
      Can we combine node-handlers and node-values?
      Can we combine @ and node-values?
      Use FOREACH in kernel, and look for other syntactic patterns
    Open questions
      Hierarchial property value searching -- is it what we want?
      SET-PROP! -- Is it what we want?  Probably good to avoid for now.

    Text extensively on different systems

  Stabilization
    Look for other known bugs, prioritize, and fix

Notes
-----

  To build Linux wxWindows, configure as:

    $ CC=gcc-3.0 CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure --disable-shared
