  TValue Cleanup
/   operator== should compare
/   operator== on uninitialized values should throw exception
/   operator== on dissimilar types should return false
/   Support all types
/   Implement some sort of get() method
/   Make sure we can store minimum and maximum int32 and uint32 values
/   Move many functions from TValue.h to TValue.cpp
/   Remove 'inline' from conversion operators
    Overhaul TVariable
    Redesign TArgumentList (for primitives)
    Redesign TCallbackArgumentList
    Test TValue extensively with real TCallbacks

  Cleanup
    Make sure GUI does REFERENCE_TEST_CASE_FILE
    Replace all old-style test cases with new-style test cases
    Remove TestCase.h inclusions from random cpp files
    Comment new macros in TestCase.h

  Node/event model
    (on cleanup ...)
    Is (on setup-finished () ...) called at the right time?
    Is UPDATE-UI the right event name?  We don't have wxWindows semantics.
    Allow elements to be attached to sequences
    Enable and disable zones in engine (for cursor purposes only?)
    PROP-CHANGE API needs work
    Do we want to systematize DRAW-BUTTON method for all zones?
    Areas in need of major refactoring
      Can we combine node-handlers and node-values?
      Deletion of elements is a mess.  Fix.
      NODE-HAS-EXPENSIVE-HANDLERS? is currently a bit tricky
      Can we combine @ and node-values?
      Look for other syntactic patterns
    Open questions
      Hierarchial property value searching -- is it what we want?
    Add EVENT-KEYS method to wrap EVENT-CHARACTER and EVENT-MODIFIERS
    Respond gracefully to errors in idle handlers
    ON should highlight method name in emacs

  Audio layer
    Bugs
      Fix stutter when switching from sine to vorbis clip (portaudio bug?)

    Useful features
      Geiger counters
        Mix pre-recorded loops with random synth
        Hook into Tamale for Geigers
        Hook into Quake for Geigers
      Hook into Quake for ambients
      Stereo panning
      Kill off Quake sound effects when leaving sim card group

    Less Important (Or Even Dubious)
      We're clipping the last 0.1 seconds or so (actually, I think
        portaudio is), and we should fix this
,     Try to get complete code coverage testing Vorbis playback path

  Make TException stop reporting line numbers

  Rename 'foo::ptr' in TestCase to better represent smart-pointer nature?

Older Stuff
-----------

  Object store
    Implement data types
/     Basic value types (string, int, float, point, rect, color)
/     Maps
/     Lists
/     Objects
    Operations
/     Set
/     Insert
/     Delete
      Move
      Copy within and between stores
    Model-View-Controller
      Change-notification system
    Transactions
/   Serialization
/     Serialize basic value types

/     Serialize objects
/   Deserialization
/     Choose an XML parser
/     Deserialize basic value types
/     Deserialize maps & lists
/     Deserialize objects
/   Cleanup
X     Consider using boost::shared_ptr<Datum>
/     Consider renaming DataStore to model
/     Rename some FooDatum classes to Foo
/     Improve the load/save API
    Testing
      Test format version support

Long Term
---------

  wxWindows Port
    Improve movie-controller event-handling
    Improve full-screen mode on Windows (and Mac?)
    Text extensively on different systems

  Stabilization
    Look for other known bugs, prioritize, and fix
    Testing

  Big Stuff
    Section 508
    Field-customizability
    SCORM and/or mainstream LMS software
    Content security
    GUI editing tools for content authors, graphic artists

Notes
-----

  To build Linux wxWindows, configure as:

    $ CC=gcc-3.0 CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure --disable-shared
