      Volume control?
      Refactor buffering class out of VorbisAudioStream
      Fix endianess in libivorbisdec?
      Fix stutter when switching from sine to vorbis clip (portaudio bug?)

    Useful features

  Send events to zones
/   Mouse left down
/   Mouse left up
/   Mouse left double-click
/   Mouse enter
/   Mouse leave
    Idle
/   Mouse grabs
  Only send idle events to zones that will try to handle them? No.
/ Use element templates for everything that creates elements
  Allow deletion of CREATE'd elements
