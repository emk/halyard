/ Remove explicit :default parameter from ATTR
  Initialization
/   Specifying the value for a keyword
/     Inheriting
/     Errors
/   Specifying a new default for a keyword
/   Computing defaults & keywords based on previously determined values
/     Basic implementation
/      Shouldn't we need to declare it when failure is OK? 
/   Read-only slots
/   Classify keywords as mandatory, optional, and not allowed? Also ignored?
  Get rest of TODO list from ruby-nodes.ss (top of file, and scattered)


  Skippable vs ignorable?  Need better names.
  :writable? -> :settable?
  :mandatory? (oh, just reconsider each of the keywords)
  attr-{...} -> keyword-{...} for mandatory, initializers?
