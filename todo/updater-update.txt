=== Notes on entire update process ==

x Make updater smarter about moved files
  x Downloader should not download a file if we already have one with
    a matching hash
  x Update installer should learn how to do all necessary diffs to get
    the tree into the state it needs to be
  x Update installer should copy or move files on disk as appropriate
  x See below sections for more details
* Case change
  x Downloader should ignore case when doing manifest diff
    x No need, since the smarter downloader above should handle this
  * Update installer should delete extra files that may break things
    * .ss, .zo, .dep, and empty dirs in scripts/, collects/, and 
      engine/win32/{collects,plt}
  * Update installer should fix case of files or directories with wrong case
    x What do we do if the manifest has mixed case for the same dir?
      x Nothing special.  We're going to assume our manifests aren't bogus,
        and if they are, we'll just do something dumb like picking the first
        case we find for the dir.
  * Installer should fix case & delete extra files
    * Will shell out to update installer
* Multi-stage update
  * Update updater.ss
    * Backport lazy downloader to old updater.ss
    * Build a release of the old program with the new updater.ss
      * Engine fork?
      * Just slip that one file in by hand?
  * Add a one-off dialog saying what's going on

Things to think about:
   need to make sure we delete bad files in scripts (.ss, .zo, and .dep)
     without deleting all out of place files; people can install over other
     directories and we don't want to delete files that we didn't put
     there
   need to make sure we don't move a file out of the way and then need it
     to copy elsewhere

=== Update installer operations ===

For the update installer:
  x (optimization: treat files moved specially)
    x In this case, the optimization is actually very important for
      correctness; if we do the naive approach and do everything as
      copies via the pool, we could end up with 3 copies of all media
      on disk at once, which may end up filling up the user's disk and
      causing the update to fail in a way that breaks the program
  x Bring all needed digests into pool
    x Need to find all digests from our diff that aren't in the pool, and where
      to get them from (can be a map built from old manifest; see below for
      algorithm details)
    x Copy files that must remain where they are
    x Move files that we don't need in the tree any more
  x Delete files no longer needed, that we didn't move
  x Copy all items from pool into tree
  * Delete extra files (.zo, .ss, .dep, and empty dirs) from:
    * scripts/
    * collects/
    * engine/win32/{collects,plt}
  * Ensure case of everything is correct

=== Formal Model ===

Or maybe semi-formal model? Or maybe kinda business casual model. But
at least a model that's wearing a button down shirt and slacks.

- <filename,digest> pair: Called "file", represents a filename and contents
- Set of files: FileSet in C++ (which also carries around a size for each file)
- Can be treated as set of filenames or set of digests, depending on
  circumstnaces:
  - if we're interested in what raw materials we have, set of digests
  - if we're interested in files to delete or case rename, set of filenames
- move(file|pool,file), copy(file|pool,file): 
  A pair of a source and a destination, where the source can either be the
  pool, or a file, and the destination is a file.  Note that since we used
  to only do copies, and only from the pool, the file alone was sufficient
  to identify the operation in question.  Now that we are trying to do
  moves and copies, and use other files as sources, we now have to be
  more explicit.  We may still use the file alone to denote either a
  move or a copy from the pool.

Notations:
  tree:          The installed copy of the program
  tree':         What we want to arrive at in the end
  pool:          The pool of file contents, indexed by digest, that
                 the downloader has provided us with
  files(x):      The set of files associated with x (a location on disk or a
                 manifest).
  files(x->y):   The set of files that needs to be moved or copied from x to y.
                 As mentioned above, we may use this structure to represent
                 a set of moves or copies from the pool to the given file
  digests(x), digests(x->y), filenames(x), filenames(x->y): 
                 Ditto, considering only the digest or filename
  files(x)[digests(y)], files(x)[filenames(y)]:
                 All files in x associated with the given set of filenames or
                 digests y
  moves(x->y):   Set of moves from x to y
  copies(x->y):  Set of copies from x to y
  deletes(x):    Set of files to delete from x
  x->: Deleting x
  *->y: A move or copy where we don't yet know the source
  &: set intersection
  |: set union
  -: set difference (relative complement)
  ^: symmetric difference

What we're given:
  files(tree)   - the actual set of files in our tree
  files(base)   - set of files from our base manifest (should be a
                  subset of files(tree); not necessarily the same set,
                  since we could have random user files or files left
                  over from previous updates that didn't delete files)
  files(update) - set of files from our update manifest
  digests(pool) - set of digests we've downloaded in our pool

What we need in order to perform all of our operations:
  moves(tree->pool')  - files to move within the tree (will move via the pool)
  copies(tree->pool') - files to copy within the tree; those that don't have
                        a move available (will copy via the pool)
  deletes(tree)       - files that need to be deleted out of the tree
                        because they were in files(base) but not 
                        files(update), and weren't moved earlier
  files(pool'->tree') - once we have populated our pool with everything,
                        this is what we need to move or copy in order to
                        get to our final state.

Special purpose post processing, also available from installer:
  filenames(update->tree') - filenames (including directories) which
                             have a case on disk different than their
                             case in files(update)
  cleanup                  - A pass at the end that cleans up well
                             known trouble directories; should do a
                             check if its possible at the beginning as
                             well, so we don't wind up in a broken
                             state after everything

Getting from our givens to our goal:
(now including Eric's names for reference)

  filesNeededForNewTree
  files(*->tree') = files(update) - files(base)
     The new files we need to add to our tree; this is all we've been
     dealing with in previous versions of the updater, and has been
     called MANIFEST-DIFF.

  (not explicitly represented in Eric's pseudocode; corresponds roughly
   to digestsToGetFromOldTree)
* files(tree->pool') = files(*->tree')[digests(*->tree') & digests(base)]
                     = files(*->tree') - files(pool->tree')
                     = files(*->tree')[digests(*->tree') - digests(pool)]
     The set of files that we will add to our tree by moving or
     copyting them from somewhere else in the tree.  This set does not
     yet have the sources of the files encoded in it; it is the set of
     files we need that we will get from somewhere the tree.

  filesToMoveFromTreeToPool
* moves(tree->pool') = files(tree->pool')[files(base) - files(update)]
     We will simplify our situation by doing all of the moves and copies
     via the pool.  Thus, we will first move any files that we want to
     delete but need elsewhere into the pool.

  filesToCopyFromTreeToPool
* copies(tree->pool') = files(tree->pool') - moves(tree->pool')
     The files we need to copy out of the tree are the ones that we need
     elsewhere in the tree, but which are not to be removed from the tree.

  filesToDeleteFromTree
  deletes(tree) = files(base) - files(update) - moves(tree->pool')
     The actual files we need to simply delete is the set of files that we
     want gone (either because they will be replaced from the pool or
     because we want them gone entirely), minus the files that will already
     be gone because we've moved them out of the way.

Not needed, but can be used for assertions (none of these are used in
    Eric's pseudocode):
  digests(total) = digests(base) |  digests(pool)
     The total set of file contents that we have available to us, is the
     union of the contents we know about in our tree, and the contents
     we have in our pool.  Not necessary for later steps, but can be used
     to verify that updates are possible.

  digests(pool') = digests(pool) | digests(moves(tree->pool')) 
                   | digests(copies(tree->pool'))
     Something to help us keep track and verify that we have everything that
     we need.

  files(pool->tree') = files(*->tree')[digests(*->tree') & digests(pool)]
     The set of files that we can move or copy from the pool is equal
     to the files that we need which have digests in the pool.  
     This is not necessarily required for any later steps, but can be
     used to check the files(tree->pool') step.

  (represented as filesNeededForNewTree, because it is equivalent)
  files(pool'->tree') = files(*->tree')
                      = files(pool->tree') | files(tree->tree')
                      = files(pool->tree') 
                        | files(*->tree')[digests(moves(tree->pool'))]
                        | files(*->tree')[digests(copies(tree->pool'))]
     The total set of moves and copies we need to do out of the pool once
     it has been populated from the tree.  The several different variations
     here give us some assertions to be able to check that everything is
     sane.
